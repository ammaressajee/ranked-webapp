# Ranked - Matchmaking App

High-level plan (iterative, profit-first)

Phase 0 — Project & infra setup: repo, Angular app, Firebase project, CI/CD deploy to Firebase Hosting, basic landing page. Metrics & analytics wired. (Goal: ability to deploy public MVP landing in <48 hours.)

Phase 1 — Core auth + profile + public ladder page: Google sign-in, player profile, join ladder UI, simple leaderboard (Firestore). (Goal: get first 10 users in a city.)

Phase 2 — Challenge + score reporting + ranking: challenge flow, score submission, basic Elo/point algorithm, email notifications. (Goal: 50+ matches recorded.)

Phase 3 — Viral features & retention: shareable rank cards, referrals, push notifications (PWA), weekly digest. (Goal: 300 MAU and retention metrics.)

Phase 4 — Monetization tests: club/league onboarding, premium features trial, paid club subscriptions. (Goal: first $/mo revenue.)

Scale & native app wrap: if traction, wrap into Capacitor or build native apps.

We’ll move one step at a time: you implement the milestone → test it → tell me results → I give the next milestone.
